# Odin Grid

An exercise for the [Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/javascript-and-jquery) in which you make a grid that behaves like an Etch-A-Sketch. When you pass the mouse over the grid, the cells of the grid change from blank to colored.

One of the optional features is generating a random color for each cell in the grid that you pass over. For this, I found an excellent [one-liner](http://www.paulirish.com/2009/random-hex-color-code-snippets/) (see bottom) from web superstar Paul Irish.
